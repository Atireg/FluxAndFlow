# Session changelog

One entry per working session with Claude. Each entry is a terse summary
with the commit range, not a transcript — the "why" behind anything
non-obvious belongs in `DECISIONS.md`, not here. Keep entries short; this
file is meant to stay cheap to read at the start of a session, not to
become the record of everything that was said.

## Session 1 — 2026-10-03 / 2026-10-04

`3180d41`..`3d2eea1` (branch `ccr-584d8563-rtv32f`, merged to `main` through
`f0b9124`)

Starting point: a three.js experiment with no data model, no content
layer, and no deployment — `git log` before this session shows a single
"Initial commit".

- **Data model.** Replaced a viewport-sized, randomly-populated cube grid
  with a fixed `SLOT_COUNT` grid driven by a `projects` array. Fixed a bug
  where portrait phones got zero cubes.
- **Detail view.** Built the split view: 3D model + description. Went
  through several iterations on the camera — oblique → orthographic →
  one-point perspective, square-on to the cube, settled at 45°/30°
  (side/stacked) after rendering comparison strips. Found and fixed two
  real rendering bugs along the way: inverted fog hiding the cube, and
  faded faces still writing depth and flattening the perspective.
  Description moved out of a fixed panel into a pull-out drawer so the
  model gets the full canvas by default.
- **Mobile.** Separate lens and crop margin for the stacked (<860px)
  layout; the project bar's height is now reserved out of the fit so the
  title doesn't land on the model. Still rough: the bar + open drawer
  leaves very little vertical room on small phones (see README).
- **Assets.** The point cloud declared Draco compression it didn't use and
  wasn't using it correctly even if it had (Draco doesn't apply to
  non-indexed point primitives). Quantized instead: 2.2 MB → 922 KB, and
  stopped shipping a 336 KB decoder for nothing.
- **Deployment.** Added the GitHub Pages workflow, made the repo public,
  disabled production sourcemaps, and published for the first time.
  Working tree is clean and `main` tracks the live site end to end.
- **Docs.** This file, `CLAUDE.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` didn't exist before
  this session; `README.md` existed only as the original TODO list and
  hadn't been touched.

Open at end of session: real project copy (year/role/context/body/credits
are all intentionally blank — see DECISIONS.md), the small-phone
bar+drawer crowding above, empty-cube messaging, per-project URLs, images
in the drawer. See `README.md` for the full list.
